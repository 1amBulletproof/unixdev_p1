# Project 1: Makefiles & Perl/Python
- JHU 605.414
- Author is John Noble (professor) and myself
- I am auditing this course and thus just here to learn

## Overview
Develop a basic c/c++ program that conforms to an advisable structure (libs, bins, includes, src, etc) and use makefiles to build
your project at each level. Also package your final project as a tar file using perl or python. I was more interested in learning perl
since I already know python.
